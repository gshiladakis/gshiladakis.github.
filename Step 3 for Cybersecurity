Here’s a comprehensive guide and extended description for completing TryHackMe (THM) or Hack The Box (HTB) learning paths, tailored for someone aiming to maximize cybersecurity learning and portfolio value:

🏆 Completing TryHackMe or Hack The Box Learning Paths — Extended Description
Overview

TryHackMe and Hack The Box are online platforms that provide hands-on cybersecurity labs and challenges. Completing their structured learning paths allows learners to develop skills in:

Network scanning & enumeration

Web application exploitation

System & network exploitation

Active Directory security

Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges

Defensive security (Blue Team exercises)

These platforms are widely recognized in cybersecurity portfolios and are excellent preparation for certifications like OSCP, CEH, or Security+.

1️⃣ Understanding the Platforms
TryHackMe (THM)

Beginner-friendly with guided rooms and detailed instructions

Focuses on step-by-step learning

Offers learning paths, e.g.:

Complete Beginner → Cyber Defense → Offensive Security

Linux Fundamentals → Windows Exploitation → Active Directory

Hack The Box (HTB)

More advanced, realistic penetration testing environment

Focuses on realistic lab machines and challenges

Offers Learning Paths / Academy courses such as:

Penetration Testing Essentials

Linux Exploitation

Windows Active Directory

Web App Security

Both platforms provide certificates of completion for learning paths — great for portfolios.

2️⃣ Recommended Learning Path Strategy
Step 1: Build Foundation

Learn basic Linux & Windows commands

Understand networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, ports, protocols)

Study basic security concepts: firewalls, encryption, common attacks

Step 2: Beginner Labs

On THM:

Complete rooms like: “Linux Fundamentals,” “Intro to Cybersecurity,” “Basic Pentesting”

On HTB Academy:

Courses like “Network Fundamentals,” “Linux Privilege Escalation,” “Web Application Security”

Step 3: Core Skills

Enumeration: Nmap, Netcat, SMB enumeration

Exploitation: Metasploit, manual exploitation techniques

Web Security: SQLi, XSS, LFI/RFI, authentication bypass

Windows Security: Active Directory exploitation, password attacks

Linux Security: File permissions, privilege escalation, cron jobs

Step 4: Capture the Flag Challenges

Solve THM CTFs or HTB retired machines

Document steps in a write-up (port scanning, enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation)

Step 5: Advanced Topics

Exploit development basics

PowerShell & Bash scripting for attacks

Red Team / Blue Team scenarios

Defensive measures: IDS/IPS, logs, SIEM, endpoint protection

3️⃣ Lab Documentation & Portfolio Integration

For each lab or machine, document:

Objective: What the lab teaches

Tools Used: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, etc.

Commands & Screenshots: Step-by-step workflow

Findings & Exploits: Open ports, vulnerable services, password hashes

Lessons Learned: Security implications, defensive strategies

Screenshots: Highlight key steps and results

Optional Write-ups: Host on GitHub or personal portfolio

Example: Document your HackTheBox retired machines on GitHub with screenshots and command outputs.

4️⃣ Suggested Learning Path Timeline
Week	Focus Area
1–2	Linux fundamentals, networking basics, THM beginner rooms
3–4	Nmap scanning, enumeration, THM intro pentesting rooms
5–6	Windows basics, HTB Academy Windows exploitation path
7–8	Web application security labs (SQLi, XSS, DVWA)
9–10	Capture The Flag challenges, documenting write-ups
11–12	Active Directory labs, privilege escalation
13+	Advanced scenarios, Red Team / Blue Team labs

Adjust based on experience and daily practice time.

5️⃣ Tools and Resources for Labs

VMs & Lab Environment: VirtualBox or VMware

Attacker VM: Kali Linux

Defensive VM: Windows Server, Linux Server, AD lab

Security Tools:

Nmap, Netcat, Wireshark

Metasploit Framework

Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP

John the Ripper, Hydra

Documentation Tools: Markdown, GitHub, Obsidian, Notion

6️⃣ Learning Outcomes

By completing THM or HTB learning paths, you will gain:

Practical cybersecurity skills for offensive and defensive roles

Hands-on experience with realistic penetration testing scenarios

Portfolio-ready projects including lab write-ups and CTF solutions

Understanding of network security, vulnerabilities, and exploit mitigation

Preparation for cybersecurity certifications

7️⃣ Tips for Success

Practice consistently — even 1–2 machines per week builds expertise

Always document your process with screenshots and notes

Start with TryHackMe if new, move to HackTheBox for realistic labs

Work on retired machines for portfolio write-ups

Use virtual labs to avoid impacting production or external networks

Challenge yourself with time-bound CTFs to simulate real penetration testing scenarios

8️⃣ Portfolio Integration

Include completed labs with:

Screenshots of enumeration & exploits

Detailed command workflow

Lessons learned

Vulnerability mitigation strategies
