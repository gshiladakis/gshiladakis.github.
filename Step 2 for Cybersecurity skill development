Learn Network Scanning & Enumeration with Nmap
📌 Overview

Network scanning and enumeration are foundational skills in cybersecurity. Using Nmap (Network Mapper), you can discover hosts, identify open ports, detect services, and gather detailed information about systems on a network.

Nmap is widely used by:

Penetration testers

Security analysts

Network administrators

SOC teams

Learning Nmap helps you understand how attackers think — and how defenders detect and prevent attacks.

🧠 What Is Network Scanning?

Network scanning is the process of identifying:

🔹 Live hosts on a network

🔹 Open ports

🔹 Running services

🔹 Operating systems

🔹 Vulnerabilities

Enumeration goes deeper — extracting detailed information like:

User accounts

Service versions

SMB shares

DNS records

SNMP data

🛠 Installing Nmap
Windows

Download from the official Nmap website.

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
macOS (Homebrew)
brew install nmap

Verify installation:

nmap --version
🚀 Phase 1: Basic Host Discovery
🔹 Ping Scan (Discover Live Hosts)
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

-sn = No port scan

Finds which devices are online

Use this in your home lab network.

🚪 Phase 2: Port Scanning
🔹 Scan a Single Target
nmap 192.168.1.10

Default scans top 1000 ports.

🔹 Scan Specific Ports
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
🔹 Scan All Ports
nmap -p- 192.168.1.10
🔬 Phase 3: Service & Version Detection
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10

-sV = Detect service versions

Example output:

OpenSSH 8.2

Apache 2.4.41

This helps identify vulnerable versions.

🖥 Phase 4: OS Detection
sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.10

-O = Operating system detection

Requires root/admin privileges

🔥 Phase 5: Aggressive Scan (Common in Labs)
sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.10

Includes:

OS detection

Version detection

Script scanning

Traceroute

⚠️ Use only in authorized lab environments.

📜 Phase 6: Enumeration with NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)

Nmap includes powerful scripts for deeper enumeration.

🔹 SMB Enumeration
nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 445 192.168.1.10
🔹 FTP Anonymous Login Check
nmap --script ftp-anon -p 21 192.168.1.10
🔹 HTTP Enumeration
nmap --script http-enum -p 80 192.168.1.10
🔹 Vulnerability Scan
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.10
🧪 Practice Targets (Safe for Labs)

Use intentionally vulnerable systems like:

Metasploitable 2

OWASP Juice Shop

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)

Run them inside VirtualBox or VMware in an isolated network.

📊 Sample Output Interpretation

Example:

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29
445/tcp  open  smb     Samba 3.6.25

What this tells you:

SSH is running

Web server present

SMB likely exploitable (older Samba version)

🛡 Defensive Perspective

Learning Nmap helps defenders:

Detect exposed services

Identify misconfigurations

Audit firewall rules

Harden systems

Blue teams often use Nmap for internal audits.

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Reminder

Only scan:

Your own systems

Lab environments

Systems you have explicit permission to test

Unauthorized scanning can be illegal.
